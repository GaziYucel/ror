# Research Organization Registry (ROR) Plugin

From OJS 3.5 on, the Ror functionality will be integrated in the core. 
This means that there will be no longer a separate plugin anymore.

You can still download the Ror plugin for older OJS version: 

* OJS 3.3: https://github.com/withanage/ror/tree/stable-3_3_0
* OJS 3.4: https://github.com/withanage/ror/tree/stable-3_4_0
